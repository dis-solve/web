"Carrier-Grade Device Monitoring":
  case: |
    An Internet access provider is running carrier-grade power supplies for
    critical telecom equipement in multiple sites.
    The provider cannot find a suitable monitoring device for their specific use-case.
  mission: |
    Find an economical integrated solution to monitor the critical power supply.
    It must be reliable, easy to maintain, respect carrier-grade standards,
    and integrate with the monitoring system, the physical power supply
    and it must be moutable in the physical rackspace.
    The time to recovery in case of faillure must be quick and economical.
  solution: |
    We created an integrated solution by engineering a HAT that physically connects to the
    service port of the power supply, and a Raspberry Pi to run the power supply monitoring code
    and communicate with the global monitoring system.
    We also engineered a 3D-printed case for mounting the device securely and
  rationale: |
    The raspberry pi is efficient to implement, deploy and the failure strategy is a simple set of generic spares.
    The replacement is quick and easy with auto-config according its mac address and a configuration file in the internal gitlab repository.
    It is also safe thanks to a fallback local configuration file and a CLI-tool for diagnosis in case of setup failure.
    The HAT has a double power supply feature which is the carrier-grade equipment standard.
